# portfolio

I made this site mostly using bootstrap and it took me 2 weeks to finally complete it. It was a long process selecting all the colors, fonts, designs, layout, etc. I wanted my site to have proper and organized grid layout and I did plan how can I make it look more organzied. Making it optimised for all screen sizes and making it accessibile with all accessibility requirements was challenging for me because it needs lot of things to consider. Also, it took me little long time to complete than I expected. I learnt so many things by creating this portfolio and most important is how important is it to do proper planning and organization in order to create a perfect website. I still want to change some things in my site for example, When I'll have more projects and work I would like to make a separate work page for my website. Overall, it was a great expereinece for me and I really enjoyed working on my portfolio website and learned many things from it including those which I want to improve.
